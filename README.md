# Angular Starter

A Structured & Styled Foundation for Modern Angular Apps
<br/><br/>
This repository provides a blank Angular project designed to be your starting point for new applications. A well-defined directory and file organization to 
promote maintainability and collaboration. This starter guides you on how to best arrange your components, modules, services, and other application assets for clarity and scalability.

## Scalable SCSS Architecture

A systematic approach to SCSS, ensuring modularity, reusability, and easy theme management. The template defines a structure that includes:

- Base styles: For typography, resets, and fundamental elements.
- Utility classes: For common, single-purpose styles.
- Component-specific styles: Encapsulated styles for individual UI pieces.
- Theming variables: A clear way to manage colors, fonts, and other design tokens across your application.
<br/><br/>
## Responsive Typography & Breakpoints

A system for consistent typography across devices and intelligent breakpoint definitions for truly responsive design. This includes:

- Type scale: A well-defined system for heading and body text sizes.
- Fluid typography: Techniques to ensure text scales gracefully with screen size.
- Semantic breakpoints: Clearly named breakpoints that align with common device widths and content needs.
<br/><br/>
## Custom Styled Primitives

Reusable UI components built on top of the Angular Primitives library, providing a consistent look and feel while leveraging unstyled accessibility. 
These primitives serve as a foundation for building your application's unique design system, ensuring consistency and ease of development.
